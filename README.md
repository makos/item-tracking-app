# Item tracking app

WIP, I'm learning all the frameworks and stuff needed for this as I go.
Yesterday I didn't know how to use JS, Node.js, SQLite etc. and today
I managed to scrape this together.

Written in ExpressJS (Node.js) with Pug and Bootstrap.
Uses SQLite3 and Sequelize for database management and object models.

## Installation

````
npm install
node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
npm start
````

Should work. Tested on CentOS 7 VM and my Windows 10 PC.
